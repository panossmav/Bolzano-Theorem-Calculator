### 1. The mathematical theorem
f ,is a function, with the domain [α,b].
If: f is a continuous function in [α,b] and
$$f(a)*f(b)<0$$
Then, $$ ∃  ξ∈(a,b)⇒f(ξ)=0$$

[Theorem in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem)

### 2. Supported Functions: 
This program currently only supports up to 1000th degre polynomials.

---
### 3. Solutions 
The solutions are mostly theoretical, and the actual number will not be printed. If one of the soloutions is calculated for the theorem (from the intrevals), the solution will be printed

---
### 4. Constants
The available constants are: 
$$ e , π$$
Currently, you are only able to just input `e` or `π`(alias: `pi`) without any coefficients or powers. The values of your polynomial if suitable can be printed as a product of π or e.
